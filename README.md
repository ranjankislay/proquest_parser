# proquest_parser

This project uses Python to turn search results (in HTML format) from ProQuest newspaper archive into CSV files (see html_parsing). It also shows how to use R to preprocess (remove HTML tags, etc.,) these CSV fiels (see csv_preprocessing).


## Updates

- ProQuest no longer allows users to download search results in HTML format. One way you can get around this problem is to print search results and save them as HTML files. I updated my Python script according to this new method.

- [Cody Hennesy](https://www.lib.umn.edu/about/staff/cody-hennesy) developed a test version of [factiva_parser](https://github.com/chennesy/factiva_parser). His parser might be of interest to some of you working on Factiva data.
